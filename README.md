# AutoHotKeyAutoCorrect
AutoHotKey v2 script for AutoCorrect word by google.


Hello, I didn't find any alternatives for "Autocorrect Anything":
https://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/100293-autocorrect-anything/

and it wasn't working for me with unicode url, so I decided to update it for AutoHokey v2 and support Unicode, be free to use
